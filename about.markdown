I am Oscar, PhD student at Universit√© Dauphine where I am working on the theory of banking and corporate finance more broadly. This blog contains my thoughts on the world and my research topics. I am looking to get out a post once a week, feel free to reach out to me on bluesky if you would like to engage.
