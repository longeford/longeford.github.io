# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Personal academic website (About, CV, Research, Teaching, Blog) built with Jekyll and the remote `minima` theme, hosted from the GitHub repo `longeford/Oscar-Lange` (GitHub Pages, served at https://longeford.github.io/Oscar-Lange/; the repo was previously named `Corporate-Analysis`). A separate, older `longeford.github.io` repo also exists and serves the root domain, including 404 pages for unknown paths. The blog covers corporate finance theory and real analysis. There is no Gemfile, build script, linter, or test suite; GitHub Pages builds the site on push.

## Local preview

No Gemfile is committed. To preview locally you need Ruby + Jekyll with the `minima` gem (or the `github-pages` gem), e.g.:

```
gem install jekyll minima
jekyll serve
```

Output goes to `_site/` (gitignored). Always build internal links/assets with `relative_url` — as a project site, GitHub Pages serves it under a `/Oscar-Lange` baseurl that it injects automatically.

## Architecture

- `_config.yml` holds all site-level settings the pages read from: `author.name`/`author.email`, contact links (`linkedin_username`, `scholar_url`, `institution_url`, `github_username`), `footer.address`/`footer.disclaimer`, optional `photo` and `banner` (About page shows them only if set), `cv_dropbox_url`, `header_pages` (defines the nav tabs and their order), and the blog `permalink` (`/blog/...`). Optional features are driven by whether a key is set, not by flags.
- Top-level pages: `index.md` (About, `layout: about`, served at `/`), `cv.md`, `research.md`, `teaching.md`, `blog.md` (`layout: home`, which lists `site.posts`). The site title (the owner's name) is the only place the name appears; the About page deliberately has no name heading.
- `_layouts/` overrides minima's layouts of the same name; all layouts inherit from `base.html`. `about.html` is local-only. Local `_includes/head.html` and `footer.html` replace minima's; `header.html` (the nav, driven by `header_pages`) still comes from the minima gem.
- Local includes: `contact-icons.html` (inline-SVG icon row under the bio), `figure.html` (image with optional caption for use in page Markdown), `dropbox-pdf.html` (CV embed).
- **CV embed**: `_includes/dropbox-pdf.html` takes a Dropbox shared file link, rewrites `dl=0` → `raw=1` for an `<iframe>` viewer and `dl=1` for a download link. Updating the CV means overwriting the same file in Dropbox — the shared link stays the same.
- **Styles**: `assets/main.scss` sets minima's Sass variables (font, colours, `$content-width`) *before* `@import "minima"`, then adds custom rules. It needs its empty front matter to be compiled.
- **`_includes/custom-head.html`** (included inside `<head>` by the local `head.html`) loads the Lato Google Font and MathJax v3. The `MathJax` config object (inline `$...$` / `\(...\)`, display `$$...$$` / `\[...\]`) must stay before the `tex-svg.js` script tag.
- `_posts/` — posts named `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` with front matter `layout: post`, `title`, and optional `categories: [...]` / `tags: [...]`. These render as chips (`_includes/post-taxonomy.html`) on the post and in the blog list, linking to anchors (`#cat-…`, `#tag-…`) on `blog/topics.md` (`/blog/topics/`), which lists posts per category and tag. The permalink has no `:categories`, so categories don't change post URLs. LaTeX is written directly in Markdown using the delimiters above.

## Repo notes

- `main` is the default branch on GitHub; push changes there.
- A previous `_projects` collection and `project` layout were deleted; don't reintroduce references to them.
